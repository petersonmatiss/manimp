# Security Scanning Demo

This file demonstrates the security scanning capabilities.

## Detected Vulnerabilities Report

Based on our testing, the current system has detected the following:

### .NET Package Vulnerabilities (Moderate Risk)
- `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` v4.5.0 - Moderate severity
- `Azure.Identity` v1.10.3 - Moderate severity  
- `Microsoft.Identity.Client` v4.56.0 - Low to Moderate severity

These are transitive dependencies that will be tracked and updated as part of regular maintenance.

### Security Scanning Coverage
✅ **Filesystem Scanning** - Scans all code files for vulnerabilities
✅ **Secret Detection** - Prevents hardcoded credentials from being committed
✅ **Container Scanning** - Validates Docker images before deployment
✅ **NuGet Package Scanning** - Checks for vulnerable .NET dependencies
✅ **Weekly Monitoring** - Automated scanning for new vulnerabilities

### CI/CD Security Gates
- **Build Stage**: Filesystem and secret scanning
- **Package Stage**: Dependency vulnerability checks  
- **Container Stage**: Docker image security validation
- **Deploy Stage**: All security checks must pass

The security pipeline will automatically block any critical or high severity vulnerabilities from reaching production.
