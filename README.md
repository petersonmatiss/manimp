### Usage Examples

#### API Controller Protection
```csharp
[HttpGet("purchase-orders")]
[RequireFeature(FeatureKeys.PurchaseOrders)]
public IActionResult GetPurchaseOrders()
{
    // Only accessible to Professional and Enterprise plans
}

[HttpGet("sourcing")]
[RequireFeature(FeatureKeys.SourcingManagement, HideWhenDisabled = true)]
public IActionResult GetSourcing()
{
    // Returns 404 for unauthorized tenants (hidden feature)
}
```

#### Service-Level Checking
```csharp
public async Task<bool> CanAccessFeature(Guid tenantId, string featureKey)
{
    return await _featureGate.IsFeatureEnabledAsync(tenantId, featureKey);
}
```

#### Frontend Feature Gating
```razor
@if (await FeatureGate.IsFeatureEnabledAsync(TenantId, FeatureKeys.PurchaseOrders))
{
    <MudButton>Purchase Orders</MudButton>
}
```

### Demonstration

A complete feature gating demonstration is available:
- **Console Demo**: Run `dotnet run` in `FeatureGatingDemo/` project
